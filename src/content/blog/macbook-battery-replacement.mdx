After upgrading to an M4 MacBook Pro 16-inch, I wanted to sell my old M1 MacBook Pro 16-inch to offset some of the cost. Before listing it I did the usual checks: cosmetics, storage, battery. The battery health was at 81%. Not terrible, but buyers notice that kind of thing. Then I remembered I still had AppleCare Plus on it and looked up the replacement policy. Apple will swap your battery for free if the maximum capacity drops to 79% or below before your plan expires. Selling a MacBook with a fresh battery is a completely different proposition than selling one at 81%. My AppleCare had a few weeks left. I needed 2%.

Here's how I killed the battery on purpose and got Apple to replace it for free.

## Figuring out how Macs control charging

The first question was whether it's even possible to programmatically control charging on a Mac. I went down a rabbit hole trying to find out how macOS manages power at the hardware level, and kept running into the same name: the System Management Controller, or SMC. It handles thermals, fan speed, sleep/wake, LED indicators, and most importantly for my purposes, battery charging.

The problem is that Apple doesn't document any of this publicly. There's no developer guide, no API reference, nothing. A developer [asked Apple directly](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/46025) on the developer forums and got silence. The [Apple Wiki](https://theapplewiki.com/wiki/System_Management_Controller) has a decent overview of what the SMC is, and [Howard Oakley's writeup](https://eclecticlight.co/2021/08/28/explainer-system-management-controller-smc/) goes deeper into how it fits into the boot and power management stack. But the real breakthrough was a [GitHub issue on the bclm project](https://github.com/zackelia/bclm/issues/20) where people had reverse-engineered the specific SMC keys that control charging. That's where I learned about `CH0B`, `CH0C`, `CH0I`, and `CH0K`. Writing `02` to `CH0B` and `CH0C` tells the SMC to block charging. Writing `01` to `CH0I` forces the Mac to discharge even while plugged in. Writing `00` to all of them restores normal behavior.

One important caveat: this approach only works on [Apple Silicon Macs](https://support.apple.com/en-us/116943) (M1 and later). On Intel Macs, the SMC was a separate physical chip on the logic board with its own firmware and a different set of keys. When Apple moved to their own silicon, the SMC's functions got [absorbed into the SoC](https://asahilinux.org/docs/platform/introduction/) as part of the coprocessor architecture, but the [key interface](https://asahilinux.org/docs/hw/soc/smc/) stayed roughly the same. The CH0B/CH0C/CH0I keys were reverse-engineered on M1 machines and have worked consistently across M-series generations since.

Knowing the keys was one thing. Actually talking to the SMC was the next challenge. Here's how deep the stack goes from a Python script down to the actual hardware:

  <Typst code={smcStack} />
</div>

## Reading battery data with IOKit

Before doing anything, I needed to see the actual numbers. macOS exposes battery stats through the `AppleSmartBattery` IOService, which you can query with IOKit. Cycle count, max capacity, design capacity, all of it is in there.

```c
#include <IOKit/IOKitLib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    io_service_t service = IOServiceGetMatchingService(
        kIOMainPortDefault,
        IOServiceMatching("AppleSmartBattery")
    );

    CFMutableDictionaryRef props = NULL;
    IORegistryEntryCreateCFProperties(service, &props, kCFAllocatorDefault, 0);

    int cycles;
    CFNumberRef val = CFDictionaryGetValue(props, CFSTR("CycleCount"));
    CFNumberGetValue(val, kCFNumberIntType, &cycles);
    printf("Cycle Count: %d\n", cycles);

    CFRelease(props);
    IOObjectRelease(service);
    return 0;
}
```

Apple defines battery health as the ratio of current max capacity to the original design capacity:

<div class="my-4 flex justify-center">
  <Typst code={batteryFormula} />
</div>

So with a design capacity of 8790 mAh, I needed my max capacity to drop below 6944 mAh to hit that 79% threshold.

The tool I wrote automates charge cycling via the SMC. Here's how the logic works:

<div class="my-6 flex justify-center">
  <Typst code={batteryFlowchart} />
</div>

The loop drains to 5% then charges back to 95%, over and over. Each full cycle degrades the battery slightly. The program checks health every minute and stops once it hits the 79% target, re-enabling normal charging on exit.

One thing to do before running this: turn off [Optimized Battery Charging](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/mac-help/mchlfc3b7879/mac) in System Settings > Battery. macOS learns your charging habits and will cap the charge at 80% if it thinks you're going to stay plugged in. That directly fights what we're trying to do here, since the tool needs to charge all the way up to 95% to get a full depth-of-discharge cycle.

With that out of the way, I wanted a rough estimate of how long the whole thing would take. Apple's [design spec](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102888) says MacBook batteries retain 80% of original capacity at 1,000 charge cycles, which averages out to about 0.02% degradation per cycle. But that's for normal use with shallow discharges. [Battery University's research](https://www.batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-808-how-to-prolong-lithium-based-batteries) on lithium-polymer cells shows that full depth-of-discharge cycles, draining from near-full to near-empty like this tool does, wear the battery about 6-7x faster than shallow ones. So I was expecting something closer to 0.04-0.08% per cycle. From 81% down to 79% is a 2% drop. At the design spec rate adjusted for deep cycling, that's somewhere around 25-50 full loops. Each one took 4-5 hours depending on what else was running, so I was looking at roughly a week and a half of nonstop cycling. Not quick, but I still had a few weeks of AppleCare left.
